In web development, the CSS box model refers to how HTML elements are modeled in browser engines and how the dimensions of those HTML elements are derived
from CSS properties. 
It is a fundamental concept for the composition of HTML webpages.
The guidelines of the box model are described by web standards World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifically the CSS Working Group.
